          <h1>Brandon Hansen</h1>
          <p>Brandon Hansen is a software developer passionately passionately encouraging everyone within earshot to get to writing code.</p>
          <p>Over the years Brandon has built applications used by millions of users all over the world, had apps rejected by Apple for being too dangerous (seriously), and dabbled in seemingly every language known to man (ok, maybe not all the esoteric languages, but still).</p>
          <p>Brandon is a father to three young soon-to-be programmers and a wife who refuses to write code.</p>
