              I love to code. I have 3 awesome (young) kids. Before my first one was born, I thought to myself, "I need to figure out a way to use her language to illuminate mine." <strong>A is for Array</strong> was born that day. It has been a few years since then.

              My kids often come in to my office and each time are greeted with a few pieces of candy and/or snacks. When my oldest daughter was asked what it is that I do, she responded with, "He goes to work and eats candy and plays on his computer." The dream was reawakened.
            </p>

              I am sure that many of you guys (and gals) share similar experiences, hearing whispers of "code monkey" and the like from friends, family, and curious coworkers. Well, <strong>A is for Array</strong> is here to save the day. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Full of beautiful illustrations illuminating the concepts that programmers work with daily, the book aims to give your loved ones an insight into your world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Share this book with your little programmers-to-be.
